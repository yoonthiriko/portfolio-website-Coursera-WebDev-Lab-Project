# My Portfolio Website

This repository contains the code for a **Portfolio Website**, which was developed as part of the **Coursera Web Development Lab Tutorial**. The website showcases various projects, skills, and a contact form. Please note that the information and projects displayed on the website are part of the tutorial exercises and are not real or personally owned by me.

## Project Overview

The website was created using the following technologies:

- **HTML**: For structuring the web content.
- **CSS**: For styling the content and making the website responsive.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactive elements like form handling and modal pop-ups.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the website looks good on all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Projects Section**: A display of dummy projects created as part of the tutorial.
- **Contact Form**: A non-functional form demonstrating basic form handling using HTML and JavaScript.
- **Recommendations**: Visitors can leave a recommendation, with a modal "Thank you" message after submission.

## Purpose

This portfolio website was built as part of the **"Introduction to Web Development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript"** course on Coursera. It was created to help me practice and improve my web development skills. The content and data presented on the website are **not real** and do not represent actual work or personal information.
